This is a Loss recovery calculator.

version :: 0.3

Its purpose: calculate the minimal sale value of stocks purchased on a call option exercise in order to recoup
  option expenses and additional losses.
  
 Inputs:
  Option price           -> the price of purchasing the option per share (the program handles the *100 multiplication)
  Exercise price         -> the price per share on exercising the option (the program handles the *100 multiplication)
  Losses                 -> the amount of losses to be recouperated (in positive value form, program handles the math)
  Max Number of Options  -> the maximum number of options willing to be purchased
  
 The program will ask if the user wishes to see the math as an additional output.
 Selecting yes (y) will add two additional lines to each option output showing
 the math for the sale (profits) and expenditures (losses) in total
 
    Example:
          For 1 options, minimum sale price to recover losses is: $17.95
              This gives a total profit gain of $0.03
              Options sale value: 1 options * 100 shares * $17.9503 = $1795.03
              Total loss and option expenses: 1 options * 100 shares * 2.95 + 1500= $1795.00
 
 If user selects no (n) the output is simply the minimum value to sell the shares
 in order to cover the losses and option expenditures, as well as a second line
 showing any profit past the recouperation.
 
    Example:
          For 1 options, minimum sale price to recover losses is: $17.95
              This gives a total profit gain of $0.03
